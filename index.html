        <h2>The Need</h2>
        <p>We’ve all been there… You’re out there in the deep blue… Maybe you need to ask for directions. Maybe you’ve encountered a new friend. Maybe there’s a predator lurking nearby! You need the capability to communicate your needs, and understand the needs of others.
        </p>

        <p>Dolphins are all about the chat and a "click" is worth a thousand words! The DSRC is committed to bridging the gap in communication between dolphins and humans. With your help, we can buy a yacht and allow you to watch us enhance our lives through meaningful dolphin conversation!

        <h2>The Deal with Dolphins</h2>
        <p>It's easy to think of dolphins as easy-going and optimistic creatures. But the dolphin's heart is a sensative one and one that is prone to offense and upset. There is nothing a dolphin hates more than being belittled. Politeness and propriety is foremost in dolphin society and rudeness is seldom tolerated. We all need to work together to ensure that our dealing with dolphins is approached with sensitivity and doesn't lead to hurt feelings
